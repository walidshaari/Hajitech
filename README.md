Core data/api services to build Hajj focuses technical solutions

## Inspiration

**  وَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا أَحْيَا النَّاسَ جَمِيعاً **
**"And whoever saves one; it is as if he had saved mankind entirely", Surat Al-Mā'idah, verse 32.**

**  من كان في حاجة أخيه كان الله في حاجته  **
** If anyone fulfills his brother's needs, Allah will fulfill his needs **

At first, we thought an app that helps save lives is the noblest. We knew we can contribute in saving lives by ensuring the fastest response of medical staff and volunteers (doctors, nurses, certified CPR/first aid volunteers)  to reach people in need. However, we soon realized that almost all of the Hajj technical problems can be solved more easily by exploiting the common factor: data assoictaed with both space, and time _SpatioTemporal data_.
